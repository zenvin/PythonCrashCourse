    "Now that you've mastered the basic skills, you need ot write organized programs that are easy to use, it's time to think about making your programs even more relevanta and usable. In this chapter you'll learn to work with files so your programs can quickly analyze lots of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn to handle errors so your programs don't crash when they encounter unexpected situations. You'll learn  about *exceptions*, which are special objects Python creates to manage errors that airse while a program is running. You/ll also learn about the `json` module, which allows you to save user data so it isn't lost when your program stops running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to work with files and save data will make your programs easier for people to use. Users will be able to choose what data to enter and when to enter it. Users will be able to choose what data to enter and when to enter it. People can run your program, do some work, and then close the program and pick up where they left off later. Learning to handle exceptions will help you deal with situations in which files don't exist and deal with other problems that can cause your programs to crash. This will make your program more robust when they encounter bad data, whether it comes from innocent mistakes or from malicious attempts to break your programs."

    "line 3: `open()` To do any work with a file, even just printing its contents, you first need to *open* the file to access it. The `open()` functions needs one argument: the name of the file you want to open.  Python looks for this file in the directory where the program that's currently being executed is stored. In this, *file_reader.py* is currently running, so Python looks for *pi_digits.txt* in the directory where *file_reader.py* is stored. The `open()` function returns an object representing the file. Here, `open('pi_digits.txt')` returns an object representing *pi_digits.txt*. Python assigns this object to `file_object`, which we'll work with later in the program.\n",

    "**Note**: We call `open()` in the program but not `close()`. You could open and close the file by calling `open()` and `close()`, but if a bug in your program prevents the `close()` mehtod from being executed, the file may never close. Improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted. And if you call `close()` too early in your program, you'll find yourself trying to work with a *closed* file (a file you can't access), which leads to more errors. It's not always easy to know exactly when you should close a file, but with the structure shown here, Python will figure that out for you. All you have to do is open the file and work with it as desired, trusting that Python will close it automatically when the `with` block finishes execution.\n",

For example, in the path \"C:\\path\\to\\file.txt\", the sequence \\t is interpreted as a tab. If you need to use backslashes, you can escape each on in the path, like this: \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\file.txt\"."
