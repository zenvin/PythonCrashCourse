#You can change the value of a variable in your program at any time, and Python will always keep track of its current value.

# Variable rules: can only contain letters, numbers and underscore. Can start with a letter or underscore, but not a number. 
# Spaces are not allowed in variable names.
# Avoid using Python keywords and function in a variable name.
# Variable names should be short by descriptive.
# Be careful with the lower case letter l and uppercase O, as they can be confused with 1 and 0.
# Use lowercase for now.

#Variables are labels.

#TRY IT YOURSELF

# Assign a message to a variable, and then print that message
