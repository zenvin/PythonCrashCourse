#Python calls any number with a decimal point a float. It refers to the face that a decimal point ca appear at any position in a number. 
#When you divide any tow numbers, even if they are integers that result in a whole number, you'll always get a float. 4/2 = 2.0
#If you mix an integer with a float, you will also get a float as well.

#Underscores can be used with writing out long numbers to make it easier to understand. 
# 1000 is the same as 1_000 as the same as 10_00

#You can assign values to more than one variable in a single line. 
# x, y, z = 0, 0, 0, 

#Constants like a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a program. Python doesn't have built-in constant types, but Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed.
# MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000 make the variable all capital letters for CONSTANTS
