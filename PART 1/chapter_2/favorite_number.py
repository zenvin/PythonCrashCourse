#Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then, using a varaible, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.

fav_num = 8
message = "My favorite number is " + str(fav_num) + ". What's yours?"
print(message)

#Takeaway from this lesson is that fav_num was originally an int, so to print in a string, it needs to be converted.
