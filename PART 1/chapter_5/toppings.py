#CHECKING FOR INEQUALITY

#To determine whether two values are not equal, you can combine an exclamation
#point and an equal sign (!=). An '!' represent 'not' in programming lang.

requested_topping = 'mushrooms'

if requested_topping != 'anchoives': #comapres the value of requested_topping to anchoives.
	print("Hold the anchoives!")

#if the two values match, Python returns False and does not run the code following the if statement.

#Most of the conditional expression you write will test for equality, but
#sometimes you'll find it more efficient to test for inequality.
