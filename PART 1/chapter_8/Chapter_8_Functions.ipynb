    "### Preventing a Function from Modifying a List\n",
    "Sometimes you'll want to prevent a function from modifying a list. For example, say that you start with a list of unprinted designs and write a function to move them to a list of completed models, as in the previous example. You may decide that even though you've printed all the designs, you want to keep the original list of unprinted designs for your records. But because you moved all the design names out of `unprinted_designs`, the list is now empty, and the empty list is the only version you have; the original is gone. In this case, you can address this issue by passing the function a copy of the list, not the original. Any changes the function makes to the list will affect only the copy leaving the original list intact.\n",

But this time it uses a copy of the original unprinted designs list, not the actual `unprinted_designs` list. The list `completed_models` will fill up with the names of printed models like it did before. but the original list of unprinted designs will be unaffected by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though you can preserve the contents of a list by passing a copy of it to your functions, you should pass the original list ot the functions unless you have a specific reason to pass a copy.

    "In this chapter you learned how to write functions and to pass arguments so that your functions have access to the information they need to do their work. You learned how to use positional and keyword arguments, and how to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. You saw functions that display output and functions that return values. You learned how to use functions with lists, dictionaries, `if` statements, and `while` loops. You also saw how to store your functions in separate files called *modules*, so your program files will be simpler and easier to understand. Finally, you learned to style your functions so your programs will continue to be well-structured and as easy as possible for you and others to read.\n",

    "One of your goals as a programmer should be to write simple code that does what you want it to, and functions help you do this. They allow you to write blocks of code and leave them alone once you know they work. When you know a function does its job correctly, you can trust that it will continue to work and move on to your next coding task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fucntions allow you to write code once and then reuse that code as many times as you want. When you need to run the code in a function, all you need to do is write a one-liner call and the function does its job. Whenyou need to modify a function's behavior, you only have to modify one block of code, and your change takes effect everywhere you've made a call to that function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using functions makes your programs easier to read, and good functio names summarize what each part of a program does. Reading a series of function calls gives you a much quicker sense of what a program does than reading a long series of code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions also make your code easier to test and debug.  When the bulk of your program's work is done by a set of functions, each of which has a specific job, it's much easier to test and maintain the code you've written. You can write a separate program that calls each function and tests whether each function works in all the siutations it may encounter. When you do this, you can be confident that your functions will work properly each time you call them. "
